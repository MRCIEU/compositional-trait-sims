# Compositional trait simulations

Compositional traits are those that 

- What happens when you do straightforward GWAS of compositional phenotypes and feed into MR?
- What happens when there is measurement error?
  - e.g. 3 traits (buckets) - some of the signal in bucket 1 goes into each of the other two buckets
  - e.g. 3 traits (buckets) - some of the signal in bucket 1 goes into both of the other two buckets
